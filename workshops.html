            <p class="description"> Don't believe everything you hear! Hardware is useful, even to a software engineering student. In this beginner's Raspberry Pi workshop we'll debunk the myth that hardware is "scary" or "too challenging to use". Together we'll review the basics of a Raspberry Pi including how it works, what's on it, when to use it, how to set it up, and how to make cool projects with it. After you complete this session you'll be able to focus on ideation for projects and get to hacking! Bring your laptop (a Raspberry Pi kit will be provided for you)!

                This session is designed for people who have had very little (or no) experience with building web pages and/or who have built pages with a WYSIWYG editor but want to understand what the code looks like "on the backend" and what's really going on. We'll look first at the "guts" of the web: how servers and websites work and how the HTML languages is constructed. Then we'll move on to page structure and building a simple web page (we'll use github to host it, so you'll get to learn a really common version control system too). Then we'll look at how CSS has changed the web landscape and what you can do with CSS, as well as talking about the best resources for learning more about CSS. During the second part of our session, we'll talk some about what the web industry is like today: what the web-related roles are, what they are typically responsible for, and what background education and skills each of those types of people usually have.

They will learn how to leverage the platform to create and deploy web and mobile applications using the programming language of their choice. Bluemix is an open-standards, cloud-based platform for building, managing, and running apps of all types, such as web, mobile, big data, and smart devices. It is based on the Cloud Foundry open source platform as a service (PaaS), and enables developers to quickly and easily create, deploy, and manage applications on the cloud. During the workshop we will go through several tutorials including database management, Watson, IoT and other services available on Bluemix. Students are required to pre-register for a free IBM Bluemix account before the workshop to save time at ibm.biz/rtpcloud

               We design products or interfaces for all type of users, and no two users are alike. Users have different backgrounds, experiences and expectations. When asking for an intuitive interface, they really ask for an interface that meets their specific expectations. To design products that feel intuitive for most users we first need to understand what intuition. In this workshop, we will focus on the actions that the design of an object suggests to its user. Affordances provide strong clues so that no instructions or labels are needed. You will be given limited materials to design an interactive object or device.

            <p class="description">The workshop emphasizes Design Thinking, a process for tackling complex challenges creatively and with an emphasis on the human - whether that's your customer, your colleagues, your client, or yourself. You will learn and practice skills related to qualitative research, insights development, getting groups to bigger ideas, rapid prototyping, and storytelling. By the end, you'll walk away with a common language and process to take back to your team to invoke more successful and creative collaboration.
